# Desktop Virtual Assistant
    
## Updates
  4/13/2022 - Initial README.MD created

## Description
This project is to create a virtual desktop assistant similar to Microsoft's Cortana.
Some highlights of the project will include accurate speech recognition, basic user interaction functions,
& potentially safety features such as secure password storage and password suggestion.

# Functions and tasks that will be implemented
    [1] Use speech recognition to understand and parse out user specifed actions such as:
        "Open new Word Document", "Delete Folder Tools", "Empty Recycling Bin"
      
    [2] Implement the previously parsed tasks.
    
    [3] Implement periodic emotion detection using the users camera. This could be used to
        offer advice or give relevant quotes that may aid the user.
